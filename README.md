   - Add these values to the `.env` file:

     ```
     CLOUD_NAME=your_cloud_name
     CLOUD_API_KEY=your_api_key
     CLOUD_API_SECRET=your_api_secret
     ```

3. Set the secret for your Cloudinary storage:
   - Add a `SECRET` key to your `.env` file and set it to a secure value:

     ```
     SECRET=your_cloudinary_secret
     ```

4. Install project dependencies using npm:
